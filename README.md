# Monitorctl

This is a small program which can be used for controlling connected monitors over DDC/CI

Its not as feature rich or complete as ddcutil or ddccontrol, however it is slightly faster for my needs.

This is the first go program I have written so I wouldn't use this codebase as a reference for anything.

### Improvements

 * Expose JSON interface for getting monitor details and controlling them
